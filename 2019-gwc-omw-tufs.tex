We describe the linking of the TUFS Basic Vocabulary Modules, created for
on-line language learning, with the Open Multilingual Wordnet.  The
links are then used to (i) evaluate existing wordnets, (ii) add data
to these wordnets and (iii) create new open w1ordnets for Khmer,
Korean, Lao, Mongolian, Russian, Tagalog, Urdu and Vietnamese.

\subsection{TUFS Open Language Resources}


The data comes from the basic vocabulary words and example sentences
in 24 languages in the TUFS Open Language Resources
\citep{Kawaguchi:2007}.  These have also been used as a basis for the TUFS Asian Language
Parallel Corpus, or TALPCo \citep{}.

The Japanese component consists of 799 basic vocabulary words with
example sentences for them. These basic vocabulary words were selected
in accordance with the lowest level of the Japanese Language
Proficiency Test, i.e. N5 (equivalent to Level 4 in the old
system). The example sentences are given in a formal conversational
register.  Some of the vocabulary is a little old fashioned (for
example 万年筆 \jpn[fountain pen]{mannenhitu} or フィルム 
\jpn[(photgraphic) film]{firumu}).   We give the translations
for 先生 \jpn[teacher]{sensei} in Table~\ref{tab:teacher}.  We see
here that different languages offer extra information as free text: German, French and Vietnamese have male and
female versions: Russian differentiates school and university
teachers.  Further, Arabic offers irregular plurals and Chinese pinyin
transliterations.\marginpar{translate}

The vocabulary also comes with example sentences, all glossed in
Japanese (as the material is aimed at Japanese learners.  The
sentences are not the same across all languages, although there is a
revised corpus parallel in seven languages for TALPCo: Japanese,
Burmese (Myanmar), Malay, Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese and English
\citep{}.   This has not been fed back into the original
data.\marginpar{Hiroki: will it?}

505 have translations in more than fifteen, we focus on linking them to
wordnet due to the diminishing returns for the rest.

\section{Instructions for Link Checkers}

The main goal of this task is to link the concepts in the TUFS
vocabulary list with concepts in wordnet.  A straight forward example
is January: \href{14674}{the entry in tufs} matches with a
\href{http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/cgi-bin/wn-gridx.cgi?usrname=&gridmode=grid&synset=15210045-n&lang=eng&lang2=eng}{single
  wordnet synset}, and it matches through multiple languages.

A more typical example is \lex{dog}.  This has entries for 5 languages
in TUFS: (fr: chien; ja: 犬, ms: anjing, ur: \texturdu{کتا} and my: \myanmar{ခွေး}).  
These match to several synsets in OMW: 

\begin{figure}[htpb]

\begin{tabular}{lcrlp{3cm}p{5cm}}

You will be given a large collection of candidate mappings (as a tab
separated file)\footnote{You should read this in with a spreadsheet,
  and sort by score and TUFS id}.  Your job
is to take the column marked Check and add '1' if it is a good match.
If it is not, you can either mark it '0' or leave it blank.  If you
mark it as '?' then it means you are not sure, and wish to discuss it
with your supervisor.    


In general, the top scoring entry (or entries) are much more likely to
be good, and the ones below less so.  If there are many matches (which
often happens) and you have one or two good matches near the top, you
can check the rest quite quickly.  Please take into account the part
of speech as well as the meaning: \textbf{n} is noun, \textbf{v} is
verb, \textbf{a} is adjective and \textbf{r} is adveRb.



We will give you an html document with all the TUFs entries in them,
with explanations, linked to the vocabulary module.  We show part of the entry
for 'dog' in Figure~\ref{fig:tufs-inu}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{inu-html.png}
  \caption{TUFs concept summary for 'dog' (and 'puppy')}
  \label{fig:tufs-inu}
\end{figure}

In addition to the columns shown in Figure~\ref{fig:linking}, there
are also columns for the Japanese and Chinese lemmas and definitions
(where available).  You can look up the wordnet synsets on the OMW
page:
\href{http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/cgi-bin/wn-grid.cgi?usrname=&gridmode=gridx&synset=02084071-n&lang=eng&lang2=eng}{entry
  for 02084071-n}.  You can cut and paste the synset ids
(e.g. 02084071-n) into the search window, or search for the lemma.


\subsection{Problematic cases}

The main problems with linking is when the granularity is not the
same.  For example, TUFS has a single entry for 切る \textit{kiru} with
two meanings listed ``switch off'' and ``cut''.    These link to very
different concepts in  wordnet.  In this case, you should link to both
concepts, and make a note: these should be two concepts in TUFS.

Sometimes the senses in wordnet are very fine: for today it has both 
15156001-n ``the day that includes the present moment (as opposed to
yesterday or tomorrow)'' and 15262921-n ``the present time or age''.
In this case you can link to both if you think both senses are likely
to be used in all languages.  Again, make a note as to which you think
is the best match.

\subsection{Errors in the resources}

If you find errors in either TUFS or wordnet, including the Japanese
and Chinese lemmas and definitions, please make a note.

For example, the Japanese wordnet has '洋犬' as an entry for the
synset for dog, but it should be a hyponym (foreign (Western) breed of
dog).
